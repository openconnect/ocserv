* Version 1.1.1 (released 2020-09-21)
- Fixed compatibility with OpenBSD that lacks procfs (#312)
- Improved rate-limit-ms and made it dependent on secmod backlog. This
  makes the server more resilient (and prevents connection failures) on
  multiple concurrent connections (#310)
- Added namespace support for listen address by introducing the
  listen-netns  option (#316)
- Disable TLS1.3 when cisco client compatibility is enabled. New
  anyconnect clients seem to supporting TLS1.3 but are unable to handle
  a client with an RSA key (#318)
- Enable a race free user disconnection via occtl (#59)
- Added the config option of a pre-login-banner (#313)
- Ocserv siwtched to using multiple ocserv-sm processes to improve scale,
  with the number of ocserv-sm process dependent on maximum clients and
  number of CPUs. Configuration option sec-mod-scale can be used to override
  the heuristics.
- Fixed issue with group selection on radius servers sending multiple
  group class attribute (#322).


* Version 1.1.0 (released 2020-06-16)
- Switch from fork to fork/exec model to achieve better scaling and ASLR
  protection. This introduces an ocserv-worker application which should be
  installed at the same path as ocserv (#285).
- When Linux OOM takes control kill ocserv workers before ocserv-main
  or ocserv-secmod (#283).
- Disable TCP queuing on the TLS port.
- Fix leak of GnuTLS session when DTLS connection is re-established (#293).


* Version 1.0.1 (released 2020-04-09)
- Prevent clients that use broken versions of gnutls from
  connecting using DTLS (#277).
- occtl: added machine-readable fields in json output (#271).
- occtl: IPs in ban list value is now reflecting the actual
  banned IPs rather than the database size (#272).


* Version 1.0.0 (released 2020-03-20)
- Avoid crash on invalid configuration values.
- Updated manpage generation to work with newer versions of ronn.
- Ensure scripts have all the information on all disconnection types (#231)
- Several updates to further restrict the control that worker processes have
  on the main process. Patches by Alan Jowett (#251, #252, #245, #247, #246)
- Add support for RFC6750 bearer tokens. This adds the "auth=oidc" config
  option. See doc/README-oidc.md for more information (#240).
- Add USER_AGENT, DEVICE_TYPE and DEVICE_PLATFORM environment variables when
  connect/disconnect scripts execute.
- Corrected issue with DTLS-PSK negotiation which prevented it from being
  enabled.
- Improved IPv6 handling of AnyConnect client for Apple ios (#254).
- Fixed issue with Radius accounting (#269).


* Version 0.12.6 (released 2019-12-28)
- Improved IPv6 support for anyconnect clients. Patch by Leendert van Doorn.
- The 'split-dns' configuration directive can be used per-user (#229).
- The max-same-clients=1 configuration option no longer refuses the
  reconnection of an already connected user (#223).
- Added openat() to the accepted list of seccomp calls. This allows ocserv
  to run under certain libcs (#185).


* Version 0.12.5 (released 2019-10-16)
- Fixed issue with FreeBSD tun devices closing (#213).
- Added configuration option udp-listen-host. This option supports different
  listen addresses for tcp and udp such as haproxy for tcp, but support dtls
  at the same time.
- occtl: fixed json output of show status command. Introduced tests
  for checking its json output using yajl (#220).
- occtl: use maxminddb when available.


* Version 0.12.4 (released 2019-07-03)
- Added support for radius access-challenge (multifactor) authentication.
- Fixed race condition when connect-script and disconnect-script are
  set, which could potentially cause a crash (#208).
- Perform quicker cleanup of sessions which their user explicitly
  disconnected (#210).


* Version 0.12.3 (released 2019-03-12)
- Fixed crash when no DTLS ciphersuite is negotiated.
- Fixed crash happening arbitrarily depending on handled string
  sizes (#197).
- Fixed compatibility issue with GnuTLS 3.3.x (#201).
- occtl: print the TLS session information, even if the DTLS channel
  is not established.


* Version 0.12.2 (released 2019-01-10)
- Added support for AES256-SHA legacy cipher. This allows the anyconnect
  clients to use AES256.
- Added support for the DTLS1.2 protocol hack used by new Anyconnect clients.


* Version 0.12.1 (released 2018-05-12)
- Fixed crash on initialization when server was running on background (#154)
- Work around issues with GnuTLS 3.4.x on ubuntu 16.04, at the cost
  of a memory leak on key reload (#152)


* Version 0.12.0 (released 2018-04-22)
- Allow DTLS stream to come from different IP from TLS stream.
  There are situations where internet providers send the UDP 
  stream from different IP (#61).
- Increased possibilities of allowed combinations of authentication
  methods (#108).
- Corrected regression since 0.11.8 with OTP authentication (#137).
- Added support for hostname-based virtual hosts, utilizing TLS
  SNI. With that change it is possible to configure multiple servers
  running over the same port (#133).
- Rename the tun device on BSD systems which support SIOCSIFNAME
  ioctl.
- Correctly handle proxy-protocol's health commands. That eliminates
  few connection drops when proxy protocol is in use.
- Corrected crash on certain cases when proxy protocol is in use (#146).


* Version 0.11.10 (released 2018-01-07)
- Increased the DTLS handshake timeout to 60 seconds and decreased
  retransmission time to 400ms.
- Improved compatibility with certain anyconnect clients which
  disconnect and reconnect after session establishment. Sessions
  which are explicitly terminated by the user, remain active for
  few seconds (15) to allow for anyconnect clients' reconnections.
- Improved cookie behavior on client timeout. The cookies remain
  active for their validity time, allowing mobile clients to get
  into sleep and recover session using the same cookie.
- Addressed issue which could cause the security module enter an
  infinite loop while printing the available of sessions for occtl.
- occtl: added support for displaying information on available sessions,
  via the 'show session SID' option.


* Version 0.11.9 (released 2017-10-09)
- Fixed bug which caused the acceptance of invalid IPv4 address as valid (#112).
- Fixed compatibility with gnutls 3.3.8 (used in debian jessie) by avoiding the
  use of the 'VERS-ALL' priority string which was introduced in 3.3.24.
- Fixed null pointer dereference when parsing locked accounts in plain
  password authentication.
- Add support for RSA-PSS and Ed25519 private keys when used with GnuTLS 3.6.0.
- ocpasswd: when locking an account multiple times, add the '!' character
  only once. Based on patch by Frank Huang.


* Version 0.11.8 (released 2017-05-03)
- Corrected MTU adjustment due to MSS. Previously the MSS value was converted to a
  lower than the actual MTU resulting to worse (lower) MTU estimates.
  Furthermore, in Linux systems switch to the more accurate TCP_INFO socket option to
  obtain MTU information.
- Disable DTLS-PSK when operating under a unix socket. When no TLS session is available
  it is not possible to derive PSK keys.
- Fixed several issues in KKDCP protocol support; i.e., allow larger messages
  than 16kb and address issue with communication with main.
- Added support for haproxy's protocol v1 format. That allows to utilize
  ocserv, even with servers supporting the old protocol.
- Report additional statistics to syslog and occtl, such as authentication failures,
  total sessions handled, total amount of data transferred, average session and
  authentication time.
- Fix crash in main on sending reply message to worker for a banned IP.
- Increased the default max-ban-score to 8 wrong password attempts, and
  increased the default IP ban time to 20 minutes.
- occtl: added support for displaying user country in 'show user' output.
  Requires occtl to be compiled with libgeoip support.


* Version 0.11.7 (released 2017-02-12)
- Fixed compilation issue related to autogen file re-use
- Send the "vpn-profile-manifest" fields after successful authentication.
  This enables openconnect to retrieve the XML configuration.
- Enhanced the cert-user-oid config option to read the SAN(rfc822name) value.
  In that case, the username will be read from the subject alternative
  name of the certificate rather than the DN. Based on patch by Johannes Sjøkvist.
- Do not log the real internal session ID as part of occtl or radius, 
  but instead log a masked value. That ensures that access to log files or
  radius is not sufficient to access an existing session.
- radius: Handle the special Framed-IP-Address values 255.255.255.254 and
  255.255.255.255. They are currently handled as if the Framed-IP-Address
  field was not present; in both cases the server assigns the address.
- radius: on wrong password, forward any message received by radius server
  to the client as prompt. That utilizes the Reply-Message field as sent
  by the server.
- ocserv-fw: Fixed chain creation when only restrict-user-to-routes is set,
  and end all traffic to the device-specific forwarding chain. Patch by
  John Thiltges.


* Version 0.11.6 (released 2016-11-14)
- ocserv: Improved detection of mobile clients (for android and ios clients)
- ocserv: Update the worker's ID on Radius accounting messages.
  That is, even if we initially advertize the ID of the worker
  handling the client as NAS-Port, the client may eventually end-up
  being served by another process with different ID. In that case we make
  sure that the radius server is notified on the next accounting message.
  If you are using radius see doc/README.radius.md about NAS-Port, since
  that behavior may cause issues in freeradius installations.
- ocserv: Added config option 'switch-to-tcp-timeout'. That allows an
  automatic switch to TCP in case of no received UDP traffic for
  certain time (Patch by Andrew Patrikalakis).
- ocserv: Pre-load the OCSP response file; that way worker processes can
  serve it, even if they have no access to it.
- ocserv: When compiled with GnuTLS 3.5.6 automatically set DH
  parameters from the known set.


* Version 0.11.5 (released 2016-09-23)
- Added getrandom() to the accepted list of seccomp calls. This allows ocserv
  to run with gnutls 3.5.x under recent kernels.
- ocserv: relaxed the restrictions for DTLS-PSK negotiation. No longer
  require that the cipher/mac combination of TLS match the DTLS one. Introduced
  config option 'match-tls-dtls-ciphers' for this purpose.
- ocserv: added the config option 'dtls-psk'; this option allows to disable
  the DTLS-PSK protocol and utilize only the legacy version.
- ocserv: added the config option 'dtls-legacy'. When disabled it will disable the
  legacy pre-draft-DTLS negotiation.


* Version 0.11.4 (released 2016-08-05)
- ocserv: Corrected the IPv6 address advertisement to client. Instead of
  using the server's address prefix use the prefix assigned to client.
- ocserv: Added per-user-configuration option hostname.
- ocserv: Corrected the assignment of the tun device group membership in
  Linux.
- ocserv: Do not hard fail when TUNSETGROUP ioctl fails with EINVAL. This
  allows ocserv to operate under older kernels.
- ocserv: Corrected crash on worker process after client DTLS IP/port change.
- ocserv: reworked the MTU discovery. Disable MTU discovery when not requested
  and set the minimum packet size to 1280 for IPv6 and 800 bytes for IPv4. When
  the MTU discovery fails to calculate an MTU over the minimum then disable MTU
  discovery and rely on packet fragmentation. Also set the DPD packet size to
  equal the current MTU, to allow detecting broken DTLS connections.
- ocserv: updated the DTLS negotiation to conform to the latest openconnect
  protocol draft. This keeps the previous anyconnect DTLS negotiation based on
  resumption as legacy, but adds a new negotiation based on DTLS with PSK.


* Version 0.11.3 (released 2016-06-16)
- ocserv: added '/cert.pem' and '/cert.cer' HTTP handlers. These provide
  the server's certificate as PEM and DER files.
- ocserv: added '/ca.pem' and '/ca.cer' HTTP handlers. These provide
  the server's CA certificate as PEM and DER files. The handlers work
  only if the CA is part of the server's certificate chain.
- ocserv: use the same work around for openconnect v3 clients in
  earlier versions. This allows very old openconnect clients to connect
  in ocserv. Addresses issue #51.
- ocserv: added the host-update-script config option. This option
  allows to specify a script to run once the hostname of the connected
  user is known.
- ocserv-fw: fixed to correctly apply the rules in the forward chain. Report
  and fix by Lance LeFlore.
- occtl: Corrected the printing of cookie last modification time.
- occtl: Print the user's cookie on occtl show user cmd.


* Version 0.11.2 (released 2016-04-25)
- radius: replaced experimental Group-Name with Class attribute;
  the current format of Class "OU=group1;group2" allows to handle
  multiple groups.
- Do not require a client hello handshake packet to forward a UDP session;
  that is, allow any small DPD packets to be sent to the correct
  worker process.
- Do not allow to combine radius' groupconfig=true with config-per-user;
  these options are incompatible with each other.
- Fixed issue in FreeBSD, preventing the server's startup when on
  background. Reported by Carlos J Puga Medina.
- occtl: Fixes in the presentation of iroutes and cookies.


* Version 0.11.1 (released 2016-03-19)
- Several *BSD compilation fixes. Reported by Björn Ketelaars.
- The ipv4-network option in user configuration allows for prefix. Reported
  by Frank Rosquin.
- Simplified the cookie handling code by making it an index to sec-mod's
  internal state. This eliminates the need for cookie rekey.
- Simplified the UDP session (re)forwarding from main to worker. Instead
  of applying time-based heuristics to figure a valid session being
  re-forwarded, attempt to decrypt the first message and keep the new
  descriptor if succeeded.
- Added getpid() to seccomp filter of allowed system calls.
- occtl: Added the show cookies command to allow viewing all existing
  valid for authentication cookies.


* Version 0.11.0 (released 2016-02-19)
- Allow the import of a chain of more than 2 certificates when using
  GnuTLS 3.4.x. Reported by Frank Rosquin.


* Version 0.11.0rc1 (released 2016-02-03)
- Radius: send the Connect-Info attribute with the user agent string
  on authentication.
- Updated support for CHACHA20-POLY1305 to conform to latest draft
- Added watchdog to worker processes to ensure they are killed
  under unexpected long delays (e.g., the process being blocked).
- Certificates and private keys are reloaded on server reload (SIGHUP).
- The main event loop memory is deinitialized after fork to reduce
  memory taken by worker processes.
- Return HTML error message on 404, patch by Kevin Cernekee.
- Remove all uses of select() in main or worker processes allowing
  the number of connected clients to exceed 1024.


* Version 0.11.0rc0 (released 2016-01-08)
- Simplified configuration semantics. Any routes or no-routes set on the
  per-user configuration file will override any global ones instead of
  being appended.
- Added config option 'append-routes'. If set to true it will restore
  the old configuration semantics of appending the global routes to per
  user/group config.
- Added the 'restrict-user-to-ports' configuration option. This prevents
  the user from connecting to the given protocol/port combinations. It is
  intended to be used as mechanism to restrict certain users to accessing
  specific services (e.g., only web or ssh). Combined with
  'restrict-user-to-routes' it can be used to restrict a user to accessing
  only a specific service to a specific server.
- Switched to an event-driven design in main; using libev
- occtl: Added the show events command to allow viewing the users connecting in
  real time. 


* Version 0.10.9 (released 2015-10-07)
- When compiled with GnuTLS 3.4 automatically sort the certificate list
  to be imported.
- Reload the CRL during periodic maintaince if its modification time
  changes.
- Address issue with duplicate check failing on IPv6 addresses (issue #5).
- Added the ability to specify a UsersFile in plain auth for using an OTP.
  This allows to use an OTP 2nd factor authentication without having
  to rely on PAM. This change, also enables the usage of an empty password
  field in the password file if an OTP file is present.
- Allow loading DER-encoded CRLs.
- Re-added the PAM accounting method. That accounting method can be combined
  with any authentication method, and can be used to check for a valid
  system account.


* Version 0.10.8 (released 2015-09-04)
- Pass the proxy protocol information at earlier stage to main process,
  to allow the correct information to be passed at the connect script
  and occtl. Reported by Niels Peen.
- Added the IP_REAL_LOCAL environment variable to scripts. This passes
  the local IP the client connected to.
- The PAM accounting method was dropped as there was no practical
  usage of it, the way it was implemented.
- When assigning IPv6 addresses use the whole available netmask.
- occtl: Print the local IP the client connected to, with the client
  information.
- occtl: Print the configured for the client split-dns domains.


* Version 0.10.7 (released 2015-08-06)
- Added a fuzzying factor to CPU intensive, or radius communication
  tasks when initiated by worker process. That avoids a very high load
  periodically, e.g., when multiple clients connect at the same time.
- Added support for haproxy's protocol v2 format. That allows to
  report the correct client IP even on proxied sessions. It introduces
  the configuration option listen-proxy-proto.
- occtl: added -n/--no-pager option. That allows to disable pager
  explicitly.
- occtl: fixed several cases of invalid JSON output.


* Version 0.10.6 (released 2015-07-01)
- Transmit packets to the last incoming source, allowing faster switch
  of the communication channel.
- The worker processes will utilize the UDP socket address (if any),
  when reporting peer's address if the listen-clear-file option is set.
- Lifted the limit on the number of configuration options. That allows to
  add an "unlimited" number of 'route' options.
- Support encrypted key files. That adds the key-pin and srk-pin
  configuration options.
- The dbus communication option has been dropped.
- Radius: depend on radcli radius library. http://radcli.github.io/radcli/
- occtl: added -j/--json option. That allows to output in a JSON format.


* Version 0.10.5 (released 2015-05-24)
- Added tgt-freshness-time option for gssapi/Kerberos authentication
  option. That allows to specify the maximum number of seconds after
  which a reauthentication with Kerberos is required to login to VPN.
- main/sec-mod: impose long timeouts on reads from sec-mod. That would
  prevent issues when reading in a blocked in authentication sec-mod.
- radius: When using radius accounting with certificate authentication,
  properly notify of user session termination.
- radius: On definitely terminated sessions contact the radius server as
  soon as possible. For sessions that can still be resumed the radius
  server is contacted periodically after the cookies expire.
- radius: consider Acct-Interim-Interval when seen by the server.
  That will be taken into account if groupconfig=true in radius subconfig.
- Added configuration options 'persistent-cookies' and 'session-timeout'.
- radius: added support for Route-IPv6-Information, Delegated-IPv6-Prefix,
  NAS-IPv6-Address, NAS-IP-Address, Session-Timeout.
- Corrected desync of main and sec-mod by introducing a synchronous
  communication socket. Reported by Mani Behrouz.
- PAM: forward the actual prompt to worker process, and not only informational
  messages.


* Version 0.10.4 (released 2015-04-27)
- sec-mod: expire sessions which are in terminated state


* Version 0.10.3 (released 2015-04-25)
- Detection of gnutls capabilities was made dynamic. That would allow
  the server to be compiled with old gnutls version but still use new
  functionality when linked with a newer version.
- The DBUS communication channel with occtl was brought up in par
  with the unix socket based one.
- Fixed issues with FreeBSD tun device handling. Reports and patches
  by Brian Chu.
- When multiple authentication methods are set and the primary includes
  a certificate, no longer require a certificate for all clients.
- When receiving non-minimal DPD messages, reflect their contents.
  This allows using DPD for MTU detection.
- The 'try-mtu-discovery' config option was fixed to affect the DF bit
  setting in UDP packets.
- Invalidate cookies when the user terminates the session explicitly.
- Fixed 'user-profile' option when isolate-workers is set to true.
- sec-mod: Do not impose timeouts on reads from main. That would prevent
  issues when reading in a very busy system.


* Version 0.10.2 (released 2015-03-29)
- Fixed issue with stats not being transmitted to sec-mod from workers
  Reported by jacky he.
- Fixed race condition which caused a desync between sec-mod and main
  communication channel, if a user was connected at the time one was
  being added ban points.


* Version 0.10.1 (released 2015-03-15)
- Fixed issues with the handling of clients connecting with expired
  cookies. Reported by sskaje.


* Version 0.10.0 (released 2015-03-10)
- Added support for gssapi (e.g., Kerberos) authentication
- Added support for alternative authentication methods, via enable-auth.
  That allows to set a suffcient for login authentication method that will
  be used as alternative to the main authentication.
- Added support for MS-KKDCP. That is, the server can be used as an HTTP
  proxy to a KDC.
- Accounting was split from authentication. That way radius accounting can
  be used in addition to any authentication method.
- Added a score-based system for banning IP addresses. See
  min-reauth-time, max-ban-score and ban-reset-time.
- Better handling of SIGHUP, and documentation of the variables that
  are updated.
- Support for 'certificate[optional]' authentication has been removed.
- occtl: Added commands to view banned IP list, as well as a command
  to unban selected IPs.


* Version 0.9.2 (released 2015-02-18)
- Enable seccomp unconditionally for all platforms (libseccomp 2.2.0
  is more portable).
- Ensure that 'socket-file' is a relative path, so that is accessible
  from both the main and worker processes.
- Fixes in IP tun addresses assignment, and enhanced IP assigned address check.


* Version 0.9.1 (released 2015-02-15)
- Do not send IPv6 leases if the calculated MTU is lower than 1280.
- Prevent the early expiry of sessions in security module; that
  corrects session reconnections using the cookie.
- Reduced debugging messages in debug level 1.
- Allow forwarding empty passwords to auth backend.
- depend on freeradius-client 1.1.7
- fix seccomp filter in x86 systems.
- Added per-user-configuration option explicit-ipv4, contributed
  by Kevin Cerneke.
- Added configuration option 'no-route' which corresponds to
  X-CSTP-Split-Exclude.
- Fixes in BSD systems support, contributed by Stuart Henderson.
- Deprecated the certificate[optional] auth option.


* Version 0.9.0 (released 2015-01-20)
- Added native support for radius. That adds the new auth configuration
  option "radius", which has as parameters the freeradius-client
  configuration file and optionally the groupconfig option which
  instructs to read configuration from radius; the stats-report-time
  option enables interim-updates. That adds the dependency to
  freeradius-client (see doc/README.radius).
- Reply using the same address that received UDP packets are sent.
- Simplify the input of IPv6 network addresses.
- Use a separate IPC and PID namespace in Linux systems for worker
  processes. That effectively puts each worker process in a separate
  container. This can be enabled at compile time using --enable-linux-namespaces.
- Configuration option 'use-seccomp' was replaced by 'isolate-workers',
  which in addition to seccomp it enables the Linux namespaces restrictions.
- Added support for stateless compression using LZ4 and LZS. This
  is disabled by default. 


* Version 0.8.9 (released 2014-12-10)
- Added configuration option 'listen-host-is-dyndns'. That,
  if set, notifies the client with "X-CSTP-DynDNS: true", in
  CSTP headers.
- When a client's IP is re-used by the same client connecting with
  the cookie (e.g., when roaming), call the disconnect script.


* Version 0.8.8 (released 2014-11-22)
- When selecting a DTLS ciphersuite, try to match the TLS ciphersuite
  if possible.
- Use consistent ciphersuite names in occtl for TLS and DTLS
- Report the user's name on log messages.
- UDP session initialization utilizes hash tables to speed up the
  finding the corresponding TCP/TLS session.
- A new DTLS session ID will be generated for each connection. That
  allows openconnect client to figure when a DTLS reconnection is
  required (in the cases where the TCP/TLS session was disconnected).


* Version 0.8.7 (released 2014-10-26)
- Networking sockets were switched to non-blocking in worker process.
- Fixed a crash when session control is enabled but not password
  authentication. Reported by George Panda.


* Version 0.8.6 (released 2014-10-05)
- Fixes in socket handling


* Version 0.8.5 (released 2014-10-03)
- The comparison of XML fields is now case insensitive; that
  addresses issues with some anyconnect clients (report and fix
  by sskaje).
- fixed an infinite loop when asking for group if the default group
  is selected.
- Added the listen-clear-file configuration option. That allows obtaining
  plaintext HTTP sessions through a unix domain socket. That is useful
  when combined with a forwarder HTTPS server like nginx, nxweb or haproxy.
- Added the certificate[optional] auth configuration option. That option
  allows to require certificate authentication in a subset of users.
- Reverted license to GPLv2.


* Version 0.8.4 (released 2014-08-27)
- The bundled protobuf-c was updated to 1.0.1.
- Fixed a crash in the work-around for the infinite loop.


* Version 0.8.3 (released 2014-08-23)
- user-profile is allowed in per-user configuration.
- Allow partial match of /profiles.
- Fixes in the worker process main loop.
- Fixed uid check in *BSD systems; reported by Kalle Carlbark.
- Added work-around for a possible infinite loop that could occur in
  DTLS mode.


* Version 0.8.2 (released 2014-07-26)
- Solved issue with pid file being overwritten on server reload.
- pam: reduced memory usage.


* Version 0.8.1 (released 2014-06-28)

- Fix endianess issue with internal messages.
- FreeBSD system fixes, contributed by Brian Chu.
- Added openconnect 3.20 compatibility.
- Added support for session control (in PAM or any other potential
  authentication methods). That feature is disabled by default as it
  requires the security module to keep state for each connected user.
- Corrected escaping of URL-encoded passwords. Patch by Hexchain Tong.
- Fix issue which prevented reading the selected group from AnyConnect
  clients.
- Allow prompting the user for group selection when groups are available
  in the certificate.
- Forward the appropriate DNS and NBNS values when using a per-user/group
  config. Reported by sskaje.
- Seccomp is now compiled-in by default, and can be enabled at runtime.
- ocpasswd: Added --delete parameter.


* Version 0.8.0 (released 2014-05-31)
- By default unix sockets are being used for the communication with
  occtl, instead of D-BUS. That allows for occtl to connect to any
  of the running servers in the system, by specifying '-s' and the
  server's occtl socket file.
- Ocserv was modified to utilize talloc, the samba allocation
  library which can prevent memory leaks on the main server. As
  this is not a memory intensive server the overhead should not be
  significant.
- Ocserv was refactored and user authentication was moved to the security
  module. That ensures that there can be no critical memory leaks to
  the worker process.
- Added the default-user-config and default-group-config configuration
  options. These allow setting a configuration file that will be loaded
  if a user-specific or group-specific configuration file isn't found.
- Added the predictable-ips configuration option. That option allows
  to disable the default "stable" IP assignment, and use completely
  random assignment.
- The 'select-group' and 'auto-select-group' configuration directives were
  added; select-group accepts groups that a connecting client will be
  prompted to select from. Additionally a client with a certificate that
  contains multiple groups will also be prompted to select one.
- The 'route' configuration directive accepts the keyword 'default',
  and will return a default route irrespective of any other route
  directives. That allows overriding existing routes with a default
  route for specific users and groups.
- The cookies can be limited to the specific IP they were granted to.
- Cookies are now valid during the whole connection period + a timeout
  value after disconnection. That deprecates the cookie-validity config
  option and introduces the cookie-timeout option.
- Added the proxy-url configuration option to allow sending a proxy URL.
- License was upgraded to GPLv3.


* Version 0.3.6 (released 2014-05-24)

- Use a variant of memset() that cannot be optimized out while
  overwritting critical parameters.


* Version 0.3.5 (released 2014-05-08)

- Corrected issue in the stats reporting for resumed processes and
  modified its sending to be periodically, in addition to the worker
  process termination time (adds the new config file variable
  stats-send-time).
- Added the STATS_DURATION script environment variable which reports
  the duration of the session in seconds.


* Version 0.3.4 (released 2014-05-01)

- Execute disconnect script for users that their IP was hijacked by a
  cookie reconnection.
- Several small bug fixes found by coverity.
- When receiving unexpected UDP packets, check if they match a known IP and
  forward them appropriately.
- The disconnect script will now receive the STATS_BYTES_IN and
  STATS_BYTES_OUT variables that contain the number of bytes transferred
  from the TUN device.
- Fix segmentation fault during worker process exit when seccomp
  is enabled.


* Version 0.3.3 (released 2014-04-08)

- When sending IPv6 link-local addresses to peer do not include the
  zone-info.
- MTU calculations are now based on X-CSTP-Base-MTU which provides a
  reasonable value that doesn't depend on the negotiated ciphersuite.
- No longer send IPv6 information to CISCO clients that may not be able
  to handle it.
- Updated CRL support and documentation.


* Version 0.3.2 (released 2014-03-13)

- Allow a number of retries (3) in plain password authentication.
- Added doc/profile.xml to the distribution.
- ocserv's '-d' option accepts a numeric argument (0-9) that gradualy
  increases verbosity.
- Added the 'mobile-dpd' config option. That allows providing a
  longer DPD value to mobile clients to prevent waking them up
  too often.
- Added the 'idle-timeout' and 'mobile-idle-timeout' config
  options. They ensure that an idle session will be disconnected.
- Added the 'rekey-method' config option. With this option the
  advertized rekey method to the client can be overriden.
- occtl will now print the bandwidth limits, routes, iroutes, dns
  and nbns values per user.
- Added configure options to disable checking for certain libraries,
  and disable features on request.
- Corrected issue where a client disconnection was not being detected.
- Updated the included http-parser.


* Version 0.3.1 (released 2014-02-16)

- Corrected decoding of cookies. That will prevent issues where
  the server is unable to parse client cookies.
- Changed the method X-CSTP-MTU is taken into account to avoid
  smaller MTU sizes than the intended.
- Corrected IPv6 address assignment in Linux (the equivalent code
  for BSD-derivatives is untested).
- Default configuration file changed to /etc/ocserv/ocserv.conf and
  default password file for ocpasswd to /etc/ocserv/ocpasswd.
- Added support for multiple DNS and NBNS servers in ocserv.conf.
  The 'local' keyword is no longer supported.
- Added the new config options split-dns and custom-header.
- When seccomp is being used the forbidden system calls will
  return error instead of the process being killed.
- Rekey time can now be configured using the rekey-time option, and
  can also be disabled when setting it to zero.
- Rekey method changed to SSL to use rehandshakes instead of new tunnels.
- Added support for the "new" IPv6 address sending headers. That
  is enabled if the client sends "X-CSTP-Full-IPv6-Capability: true".
- occtl: fixed gathering of interface statistics.


* Version 0.3.0 (released 2014-01-24)

- Added occtl a control tool for ocserv, that can be used to query
  the server about the connected users, and perform certain actions
  such as reload the server's configuration, stop the server or
  disconnect a user.
- Added support for systemd socket-activatable service.
- Added priorities on the OpenConnect DTLS ciphersuites to ensure the
  server has a say on the selected one (and prevent clients from negotiating
  3DES when AES is supported by both).
- Better display of IP addresses in log messages.
- Added the use-dbus configuration option. It can be used to disable
  the D-BUS service (and thus the usage of the occtl utility).
- Added (optional) dependency on protocolbuffer-c, allowing a simpler 
  handling and easier extension of the internal IPC protocol.
- Added configuration option cisco-client-compat which if enabled
  it allows a client to authenticate by sending its credentials in
  different TLS sessions. A cookie is used to associate the sessions.
- Updated seccomp rules to allow the system calls used by the
  worker process.
- Allow TLS rehandshakes on the TCP channel.


* Version 0.2.4 (released 2014-01-08)

- Better AnyConnect client support for Mac and other systems. Patch by
  Kevin Cernekee.


* Version 0.2.3 (released 2013-12-15)

- Added X-CSTP-License header to client reply for mobile client
  compatibility. Patch by Kevin Cernekee.
- When a new connection presents a cookie of an existing session
  the previous session of this cookie is disconnected (and its IP is hijacked).
  If no previous session is active, the server will attempt to assign
  the previously used IP.
- If udp-port is unset or set to zero then the server will not listen
  for UDP sessions.
- When using PAM allow it to update the username.
- When always-require-cert is set to false do not require a certificate
  for cookie authentication.
- Added the net-priority configuration option.
- Corrected sending of DPD in the main TLS channel. Report and initial
  fix by Kevin Cernekee.
- Added support for cgroups in Linux.


* Version 0.2.2 (released 2013-11-23)

- The system http-parser library is used if present instead of the bundled.
- The system libopts library is used if autogen is present.
- Added --http-debug option to ocserv.
- Added support for AES-GCM under DTLS 1.2 (requires GnuTLS 3.2.7).
- More precise MTU calculation (needed in AES-GCM ciphersuites)
- Do not use an MTU larger than the one initially proposed to openconnect.


* Version 0.2.1 (released 2013-11-06)

- Added configuration directives 'rx-data-per-sec' and 'tx-data-per-sec' to allow
  setting bandwidth limitations globally or per group/user.
- Call setgroups() after setgid() to avoid propagation of supplementary groups
  to the unprivileged worker processes.
- If a system's libopts is available as well as automake then the system's 
  libopts will be used.
- Added --pid-file command line option to ocserv. This overrides any
  configured pid-file.
- The ocserv binary is now installed in sbin instead of bin.


* Version 0.2.0 (released 2013-10-31)

- Added configuration directives 'config-per-user' and 'config-per-group'.
  They allow loading an additional configuration file per user or per
  group from a directory.
- Added the ipv6-prefix configuration option to replace ipv6-netmask. The
  new option accepts IPv6 subnet prefixes.
- Added the 'iroute' configuration directive, applicable only to group or
  user configuration files. It allows setting routes on the server based on
  the connected client.
- Corrected authentication using only certificates.
- The UDP file descriptor from main to workers is forwarded once per minute
  to avoid a duplicate DTLS client hello message tearing the worker's session.
- Corrected client disconnection issues when connect-script was specified.


* Version 0.1.7 (released 2013-10-25)

- Instead of suggesting different DTLS and CSTP MTU values, suggest a single
  value to the peer. That avoids issues with openconnect which reads one of
  the suggested values and ignores the other.
- Added config option "output-buffer" to allow selecting between high throughput 
  or low latency (following similar openconnect change).
- Enabled config option "mtu".
- Configuration file parsing was modified to allow detecting mispellings of
  directives and unknown options.


* Version 0.1.6 (released 2013-09-02)

- Avoid a crash on the configuration file parser when non-ascii
  characters are present. Reported by Artem Ivantsov.


* Version 0.1.5 (released 2013-07-15)

- More robust support of PAM by allowing more than one factor 
  authentication. In practice this allows authentication with more than
  one password (e.g., with a permanent one and an one time password), as
  well as changing the password.
- Cookies are no longer stored in the server side. The server is now
  stateless. A randomly generated key is used to encrypt and authenticate
  the cookies sent to the client.
- Added test suite. It requires "make check" to be run as root (in order
  to be able to run the server).
- Bypass the AnyConnect auto-download mechanism. Patch by Kevin Cernekee.
- Unescape HTML-formatted passwords, or usernames. Reported by P.H. Vos.


* Version 0.1.4 (released 2013-06-15)

- On DTLS ensure that sent packets will not exceed the MTU.


* Version 0.1.3 (released 2013-06-12)

- Updated HTTP header parsing to correct issues seen with openconnect 3.20.
- seccomp will no longer force an exit if system calls cannot be disabled.
  Patch by Faidon Liambiotis.
- Added support for Salsa20 + UMAC ciphers.
- Will now check X-CSTP-Address-Type header and will not send address types
  that were not requested.
- X-CSTP-MTU and DTLS-MTU now contain the expected (but pretty non-sensical)
  values.


* Version 0.1.2 (released 2013-05-07)

- Several updates to allow compilation in FreeBSD.
- Allow prior to leasing an IP to ping it in order to check if it is in use.
- ocpasswd accepts options to lock and unlock users.
- Several updates to allow CISCO's anyconnect clients to connect to this
  server.


* Version 0.1.1 (released 2013-04-03)

- MTU discovery was simplified.
- Removed support for TLS session tickets to strengthen the
  notion of privilege separation.


* Version 0.1.0 (released 2013-03-23)

- Corrected issue with ocsp-response configuration field.
- Added ability to specify multiple certificate and key pairs.
- Added support for TLS session tickets.
- Added the "plain" authentication option, which allows a simple password
  file format. The ocpasswd tool can be used to generate entries for this
  file.
- The private key operations are performed on a special process to
  prevent loss of the private key in case of compromise of a worker
  process.


* Version 0.0.2 (released 2013-03-05)

- Updated HTTP protocol handling (fixes issue with openconnect < 4). 
  Reported by Mike Miller.
- Use TCP wrappers (libwrap) when present.
- Fixed issue with the 'local' keyword in DNS server.
- Added configuration options 'user-profile' and 'always-require-cert' to 
  enable non-openconnect clients to connect. They are enabled with
  the configure option --enable-anyconnect-compat.
- Allow setting a rate limit on the number of connections.
- Allow setting a reconnection delay time after a failed authentication
  attempt (added min-reauth-time option).
- Eliminated memory leaks.
- Auto-detect xml content for username and password (fixes interoperability
  with newer openconnect versions).


* Version 0.0.1 (released 2013-02-20)

- First public release
