* Version 0.10.1 (released 2015-03-15)
- Fixed issues with the handling of clients connecting with expired
  cookies. Reported by sskaje.


* Version 0.10.0 (released 2015-03-10)
- Added support for gssapi (e.g., Kerberos) authentication
- Added support for alternative authentication methods, via enable-auth.
  That allows to set a suffcient for login authentication method that will
  be used as alternative to the main authentication.
- Added support for MS-KKDCP. That is, the server can be used as an HTTP
  proxy to a KDC.
- Accounting was split from authentication. That way radius accounting can
  be used in addition to any authentication method.
- Added a score-based system for banning IP addresses. See
  min-reauth-time, max-ban-score and ban-reset-time.
- Better handling of SIGHUP, and documentation of the variables that
  are updated.
- Support for 'certificate[optional]' authentication has been removed.
- occtl: Added commands to view banned IP list, as well as a command
  to unban selected IPs.


* Version 0.9.2 (released 2015-02-18)
- Enable seccomp unconditionally for all platforms (libseccomp 2.2.0
  is more portable).
- Ensure that 'socket-file' is a relative path, so that is accessible
  from both the main and worker processes.
- Fixes in IP tun addresses assignment, and enhanced IP assigned address check.


* Version 0.9.1 (released 2015-02-15)
- Do not send IPv6 leases if the calculated MTU is lower than 1280.
- Prevent the early expiry of sessions in security module; that
  corrects session reconnections using the cookie.
- Reduced debugging messages in debug level 1.
- Allow forwarding empty passwords to auth backend.
- depend on freeradius-client 1.1.7
- fix seccomp filter in x86 systems.
- Added per-user-configuration option explicit-ipv4, contributed
  by Kevin Cerneke.
- Added configuration option 'no-route' which corresponds to
  X-CSTP-Split-Exclude.
- Fixes in BSD systems support, contributed by Stuart Henderson.
- Deprecated the certificate[optional] auth option.


* Version 0.9.0 (released 2015-01-20)
- Added native support for radius. That adds the new auth configuration
  option "radius", which has as parameters the freeradius-client
  configuration file and optionally the groupconfig option which
  instructs to read configuration from radius; the stats-report-time
  option enables interim-updates. That adds the dependency to
  freeradius-client (see doc/README.radius).
- Reply using the same address that received UDP packets are sent.
- Simplify the input of IPv6 network addresses.
- Use a separate IPC and PID namespace in Linux systems for worker
  processes. That effectively puts each worker process in a separate
  container. This can be enabled at compile time using --enable-linux-namespaces.
- Configuration option 'use-seccomp' was replaced by 'isolate-workers',
  which in addition to seccomp it enables the Linux namespaces restrictions.
- Added support for stateless compression using LZ4 and LZS. This
  is disabled by default. 


* Version 0.8.9 (released 2014-12-10)
- Added configuration option 'listen-host-is-dyndns'. That,
  if set, notifies the client with "X-CSTP-DynDNS: true", in
  CSTP headers.
- When a client's IP is re-used by the same client connecting with
  the cookie (e.g., when roaming), call the disconnect script.


* Version 0.8.8 (released 2014-11-22)
- When selecting a DTLS ciphersuite, try to match the TLS ciphersuite
  if possible.
- Use consistent ciphersuite names in occtl for TLS and DTLS
- Report the user's name on log messages.
- UDP session initialization utilizes hash tables to speed up the
  finding the corresponding TCP/TLS session.
- A new DTLS session ID will be generated for each connection. That
  allows openconnect client to figure when a DTLS reconnection is
  required (in the cases where the TCP/TLS session was disconnected).


* Version 0.8.7 (released 2014-10-26)
- Networking sockets were switched to non-blocking in worker process.
- Fixed a crash when session control is enabled but not password
  authentication. Reported by George Panda.


* Version 0.8.6 (released 2014-10-05)
- Fixes in socket handling


* Version 0.8.5 (released 2014-10-03)
- The comparison of XML fields is now case insensitive; that
  addresses issues with some anyconnect clients (report and fix
  by sskaje).
- fixed an infinite loop when asking for group if the default group
  is selected.
- Added the listen-clear-file configuration option. That allows obtaining
  plaintext HTTP sessions through a unix domain socket. That is useful
  when combined with a forwarder HTTPS server like nginx, nxweb or haproxy.
- Added the certificate[optional] auth configuration option. That option
  allows to require certificate authentication in a subset of users.
- Reverted license to GPLv2.


* Version 0.8.4 (released 2014-08-27)
- The bundled protobuf-c was updated to 1.0.1.
- Fixed a crash in the work-around for the infinite loop.


* Version 0.8.3 (released 2014-08-23)
- user-profile is allowed in per-user configuration.
- Allow partial match of /profiles.
- Fixes in the worker process main loop.
- Fixed uid check in *BSD systems; reported by Kalle Carlbark.
- Added work-around for a possible infinite loop that could occur in
  DTLS mode.


* Version 0.8.2 (released 2014-07-26)
- Solved issue with pid file being overwritten on server reload.
- pam: reduced memory usage.


* Version 0.8.1 (released 2014-06-28)

- Fix endianess issue with internal messages.
- FreeBSD system fixes, contributed by Brian Chu.
- Added openconnect 3.20 compatibility.
- Added support for session control (in PAM or any other potential
  authentication methods). That feature is disabled by default as it
  requires the security module to keep state for each connected user.
- Corrected escaping of URL-encoded passwords. Patch by Hexchain Tong.
- Fix issue which prevented reading the selected group from AnyConnect
  clients.
- Allow prompting the user for group selection when groups are available
  in the certificate.
- Forward the appropriate DNS and NBNS values when using a per-user/group
  config. Reported by sskaje.
- Seccomp is now compiled-in by default, and can be enabled at runtime.
- ocpasswd: Added --delete parameter.


* Version 0.8.0 (released 2014-05-31)
- By default unix sockets are being used for the communication with
  occtl, instead of D-BUS. That allows for occtl to connect to any
  of the running servers in the system, by specifying '-s' and the
  server's occtl socket file.
- Ocserv was modified to utilize talloc, the samba allocation
  library which can prevent memory leaks on the main server. As
  this is not a memory intensive server the overhead should not be
  significant.
- Ocserv was refactored and user authentication was moved to the security
  module. That ensures that there can be no critical memory leaks to
  the worker process.
- Added the default-user-config and default-group-config configuration
  options. These allow setting a configuration file that will be loaded
  if a user-specific or group-specific configuration file isn't found.
- Added the predictable-ips configuration option. That option allows
  to disable the default "stable" IP assignment, and use completely
  random assignment.
- The 'select-group' and 'auto-select-group' configuration directives were
  added; select-group accepts groups that a connecting client will be
  prompted to select from. Additionally a client with a certificate that
  contains multiple groups will also be prompted to select one.
- The 'route' configuration directive accepts the keyword 'default',
  and will return a default route irrespective of any other route
  directives. That allows overriding existing routes with a default
  route for specific users and groups.
- The cookies can be limited to the specific IP they were granted to.
- Cookies are now valid during the whole connection period + a timeout
  value after disconnection. That deprecates the cookie-validity config
  option and introduces the cookie-timeout option.
- Added the proxy-url configuration option to allow sending a proxy URL.
- License was upgraded to GPLv3.


* Version 0.3.6 (released 2014-05-24)

- Use a variant of memset() that cannot be optimized out while
  overwritting critical parameters.


* Version 0.3.5 (released 2014-05-08)

- Corrected issue in the stats reporting for resumed processes and
  modified its sending to be periodically, in addition to the worker
  process termination time (adds the new config file variable
  stats-send-time).
- Added the STATS_DURATION script environment variable which reports
  the duration of the session in seconds.


* Version 0.3.4 (released 2014-05-01)

- Execute disconnect script for users that their IP was hijacked by a
  cookie reconnection.
- Several small bug fixes found by coverity.
- When receiving unexpected UDP packets, check if they match a known IP and
  forward them appropriately.
- The disconnect script will now receive the STATS_BYTES_IN and
  STATS_BYTES_OUT variables that contain the number of bytes transferred
  from the TUN device.
- Fix segmentation fault during worker process exit when seccomp
  is enabled.


* Version 0.3.3 (released 2014-04-08)

- When sending IPv6 link-local addresses to peer do not include the
  zone-info.
- MTU calculations are now based on X-CSTP-Base-MTU which provides a
  reasonable value that doesn't depend on the negotiated ciphersuite.
- No longer send IPv6 information to CISCO clients that may not be able
  to handle it.
- Updated CRL support and documentation.


* Version 0.3.2 (released 2014-03-13)

- Allow a number of retries (3) in plain password authentication.
- Added doc/profile.xml to the distribution.
- ocserv's '-d' option accepts a numeric argument (0-9) that gradualy
  increases verbosity.
- Added the 'mobile-dpd' config option. That allows providing a
  longer DPD value to mobile clients to prevent waking them up
  too often.
- Added the 'idle-timeout' and 'mobile-idle-timeout' config
  options. They ensure that an idle session will be disconnected.
- Added the 'rekey-method' config option. With this option the
  advertized rekey method to the client can be overriden.
- occtl will now print the bandwidth limits, routes, iroutes, dns
  and nbns values per user.
- Added configure options to disable checking for certain libraries,
  and disable features on request.
- Corrected issue where a client disconnection was not being detected.
- Updated the included http-parser.


* Version 0.3.1 (released 2014-02-16)

- Corrected decoding of cookies. That will prevent issues where
  the server is unable to parse client cookies.
- Changed the method X-CSTP-MTU is taken into account to avoid
  smaller MTU sizes than the intended.
- Corrected IPv6 address assignment in Linux (the equivalent code
  for BSD-derivatives is untested).
- Default configuration file changed to /etc/ocserv/ocserv.conf and
  default password file for ocpasswd to /etc/ocserv/ocpasswd.
- Added support for multiple DNS and NBNS servers in ocserv.conf.
  The 'local' keyword is no longer supported.
- Added the new config options split-dns and custom-header.
- When seccomp is being used the forbidden system calls will
  return error instead of the process being killed.
- Rekey time can now be configured using the rekey-time option, and
  can also be disabled when setting it to zero.
- Rekey method changed to SSL to use rehandshakes instead of new tunnels.
- Added support for the "new" IPv6 address sending headers. That
  is enabled if the client sends "X-CSTP-Full-IPv6-Capability: true".
- occtl: fixed gathering of interface statistics.


* Version 0.3.0 (released 2014-01-24)

- Added occtl a control tool for ocserv, that can be used to query
  the server about the connected users, and perform certain actions
  such as reload the server's configuration, stop the server or
  disconnect a user.
- Added support for systemd socket-activatable service.
- Added priorities on the OpenConnect DTLS ciphersuites to ensure the
  server has a say on the selected one (and prevent clients from negotiating
  3DES when AES is supported by both).
- Better display of IP addresses in log messages.
- Added the use-dbus configuration option. It can be used to disable
  the D-BUS service (and thus the usage of the occtl utility).
- Added (optional) dependency on protocolbuffer-c, allowing a simpler 
  handling and easier extension of the internal IPC protocol.
- Added configuration option cisco-client-compat which if enabled
  it allows a client to authenticate by sending its credentials in
  different TLS sessions. A cookie is used to associate the sessions.
- Updated seccomp rules to allow the system calls used by the
  worker process.
- Allow TLS rehandshakes on the TCP channel.


* Version 0.2.4 (released 2014-01-08)

- Better AnyConnect client support for Mac and other systems. Patch by
  Kevin Cernekee.


* Version 0.2.3 (released 2013-12-15)

- Added X-CSTP-License header to client reply for mobile client
  compatibility. Patch by Kevin Cernekee.
- When a new connection presents a cookie of an existing session
  the previous session of this cookie is disconnected (and its IP is hijacked).
  If no previous session is active, the server will attempt to assign
  the previously used IP.
- If udp-port is unset or set to zero then the server will not listen
  for UDP sessions.
- When using PAM allow it to update the username.
- When always-require-cert is set to false do not require a certificate
  for cookie authentication.
- Added the net-priority configuration option.
- Corrected sending of DPD in the main TLS channel. Report and initial
  fix by Kevin Cernekee.
- Added support for cgroups in Linux.


* Version 0.2.2 (released 2013-11-23)

- The system http-parser library is used if present instead of the bundled.
- The system libopts library is used if autogen is present.
- Added --http-debug option to ocserv.
- Added support for AES-GCM under DTLS 1.2 (requires GnuTLS 3.2.7).
- More precise MTU calculation (needed in AES-GCM ciphersuites)
- Do not use an MTU larger than the one initially proposed to openconnect.


* Version 0.2.1 (released 2013-11-06)

- Added configuration directives 'rx-data-per-sec' and 'tx-data-per-sec' to allow
  setting bandwidth limitations globally or per group/user.
- Call setgroups() after setgid() to avoid propagation of supplementary groups
  to the unprivileged worker processes.
- If a system's libopts is available as well as automake then the system's 
  libopts will be used.
- Added --pid-file command line option to ocserv. This overrides any
  configured pid-file.
- The ocserv binary is now installed in sbin instead of bin.


* Version 0.2.0 (released 2013-10-31)

- Added configuration directives 'config-per-user' and 'config-per-group'.
  They allow loading an additional configuration file per user or per
  group from a directory.
- Added the ipv6-prefix configuration option to replace ipv6-netmask. The
  new option accepts IPv6 subnet prefixes.
- Added the 'iroute' configuration directive, applicable only to group or
  user configuration files. It allows setting routes on the server based on
  the connected client.
- Corrected authentication using only certificates.
- The UDP file descriptor from main to workers is forwarded once per minute
  to avoid a duplicate DTLS client hello message tearing the worker's session.
- Corrected client disconnection issues when connect-script was specified.


* Version 0.1.7 (released 2013-10-25)

- Instead of suggesting different DTLS and CSTP MTU values, suggest a single
  value to the peer. That avoids issues with openconnect which reads one of
  the suggested values and ignores the other.
- Added config option "output-buffer" to allow selecting between high throughput 
  or low latency (following similar openconnect change).
- Enabled config option "mtu".
- Configuration file parsing was modified to allow detecting mispellings of
  directives and unknown options.


* Version 0.1.6 (released 2013-09-02)

- Avoid a crash on the configuration file parser when non-ascii
  characters are present. Reported by Artem Ivantsov.


* Version 0.1.5 (released 2013-07-15)

- More robust support of PAM by allowing more than one factor 
  authentication. In practice this allows authentication with more than
  one password (e.g., with a permanent one and an one time password), as
  well as changing the password.
- Cookies are no longer stored in the server side. The server is now
  stateless. A randomly generated key is used to encrypt and authenticate
  the cookies sent to the client.
- Added test suite. It requires "make check" to be run as root (in order
  to be able to run the server).
- Bypass the AnyConnect auto-download mechanism. Patch by Kevin Cernekee.
- Unescape HTML-formatted passwords, or usernames. Reported by P.H. Vos.


* Version 0.1.4 (released 2013-06-15)

- On DTLS ensure that sent packets will not exceed the MTU.


* Version 0.1.3 (released 2013-06-12)

- Updated HTTP header parsing to correct issues seen with openconnect 3.20.
- seccomp will no longer force an exit if system calls cannot be disabled.
  Patch by Faidon Liambiotis.
- Added support for Salsa20 + UMAC ciphers.
- Will now check X-CSTP-Address-Type header and will not send address types
  that were not requested.
- X-CSTP-MTU and DTLS-MTU now contain the expected (but pretty non-sensical)
  values.


* Version 0.1.2 (released 2013-05-07)

- Several updates to allow compilation in FreeBSD.
- Allow prior to leasing an IP to ping it in order to check if it is in use.
- ocpasswd accepts options to lock and unlock users.
- Several updates to allow CISCO's anyconnect clients to connect to this
  server.


* Version 0.1.1 (released 2013-04-03)

- MTU discovery was simplified.
- Removed support for TLS session tickets to strengthen the
  notion of privilege separation.


* Version 0.1.0 (released 2013-03-23)

- Corrected issue with ocsp-response configuration field.
- Added ability to specify multiple certificate and key pairs.
- Added support for TLS session tickets.
- Added the "plain" authentication option, which allows a simple password
  file format. The ocpasswd tool can be used to generate entries for this
  file.
- The private key operations are performed on a special process to
  prevent loss of the private key in case of compromise of a worker
  process.


* Version 0.0.2 (released 2013-03-05)

- Updated HTTP protocol handling (fixes issue with openconnect < 4). 
  Reported by Mike Miller.
- Use TCP wrappers (libwrap) when present.
- Fixed issue with the 'local' keyword in DNS server.
- Added configuration options 'user-profile' and 'always-require-cert' to 
  enable non-openconnect clients to connect. They are enabled with
  the configure option --enable-anyconnect-compat.
- Allow setting a rate limit on the number of connections.
- Allow setting a reconnection delay time after a failed authentication
  attempt (added min-reauth-time option).
- Eliminated memory leaks.
- Auto-detect xml content for username and password (fixes interoperability
  with newer openconnect versions).


* Version 0.0.1 (released 2013-02-20)

- First public release
