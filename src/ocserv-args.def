@subheading ocserv's configuration file format
By default, if no other file is specified, ocserv looks for its configuration file at @file{/etc/ocserv/ocserv.conf}.
An example configuration file follows.

@example

# User authentication method. Could be set multiple times and in 
# that case all should succeed. To enable multiple methods use
# multiple auth directives. Available options: certificate, 
# plain, pam, radius, gssapi.
#
# Note that authentication methods cannot be changed with reload.

# certificate:
#  This indicates that all connecting users must present a certificate.
#
# pam[gid-min=1000]:
#  This enabled PAM authentication of the user. The gid-min option is used 
# by auto-select-group option, in order to select the minimum valid group ID.
#
# plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd,otp=/etc/ocserv/users.otp]
#  The plain option requires specifying a password file which contains
# entries of the following format.
# "username:groupname1,groupname2:encoded-password"
# One entry must be listed per line, and 'ocpasswd' should be used
# to generate password entries. The 'otp' suboption allows one to specify
# an oath password file to be used for one time passwords; the format of
# the file is described in https://code.google.com/p/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile
#
# radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true,nas-identifier=name]:
#  The radius option requires specifying freeradius-client configuration
# file. If the groupconfig option is set, then config-per-user/group will be overridden,
# and all configuration will be read from radius. That also includes the
# Acct-Interim-Interval, and Session-Timeout values.
#
# See doc/README-radius.md for the supported radius configuration atributes.
#
# gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=false,tgt-freshness-time=900,gid-min=1000]
#  The gssapi option allows one to use authentication methods supported by GSSAPI,
# such as Kerberos tickets with ocserv. It should be best used as an alternative
# to PAM (i.e., have pam in auth and gssapi in enable-auth), to allow users with
# tickets and without tickets to login. The default value for require-local-user-map
# is true. The 'tgt-freshness-time' if set, it would require the TGT tickets presented
# to have been issued within the provided number of seconds. That option is used to
# restrict logins even if the KDC provides long time TGT tickets.
# The gid-min option is used by auto-select-group option, in order to select the minimum
# valid group ID.

#auth = "certificate"
#auth = "pam"
#auth = "pam[gid-min=1000]"
#auth = "plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd]"
#auth = "radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true]"

# for authentication. That is, if set, any of the methods enabled
# will be sufficient to login.
#enable-auth = "certificate"
#enable-auth = "gssapi"
#enable-auth = "gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=true,tgt-freshness-time=900]"

# Accounting methods available:
# radius: can be combined with any authentication method, it provides
#      radius accounting to available users (see also stats-report-time).
#
# pam: can be combined with any authentication method, it provides
#      a validation of the connecting user's name using PAM. It is
#      superfluous to use this method when authentication is already
#      PAM.
#
# Only one accounting method can be specified.
#acct = "radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf]"

# The key and the certificates of the server
# The key may be a file, or any URL supported by GnuTLS (e.g., 
# tpmkey:uuid=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx;storage=user
# or pkcs11:object=my-vpn-key;object-type=private)
#
# The server-cert file may contain a single certificate, or
# a sorted certificate chain.
#
# There may be multiple server-cert and server-key directives,
# but each key should correspond to the preceding certificate.
server-cert = /path/to/cert.pem
server-key = /path/to/key.pem

# The server provides following URL handlers to obtain the certificates
# configured above:
#  /cert.pem   Returns the server's certificate in PEM format
#  /cert.der   Returns the server's certificate in DER format
#  /ca.pem     Returns the server's CA certificate in PEM format
#  /ca.der     Returns the server's CA certificate in DER format
#

# Diffie-Hellman parameters. Only needed if you require support
# for the DHE ciphersuites (by default this server supports ECDHE).
# Can be generated using:
# certtool --generate-dh-params --outfile /path/to/dh.pem
#dh-params = /path/to/dh.pem

# In case PKCS #11, TPM or encrypted keys are used the PINs should be available
# in files. The srk-pin-file is applicable to TPM keys only, and is the 
# storage root key.
#pin-file = /path/to/pin.txt
#srk-pin-file = /path/to/srkpin.txt

# The password or PIN needed to unlock the key in server-key file.
# Only needed if the file is encrypted or a PKCS #11 object. This
# is an alternative method to pin-file.
#key-pin = 1234

# The SRK PIN for TPM.
# This is an alternative method to srk-pin-file.
#srk-pin = 1234

# The Certificate Authority that will be used to verify

# is set.
#ca-cert = /path/to/ca.pem

### The options above, will remain unchanged. Note however, that the 
### server-cert, server-key, dh-params and ca-cert options will be reloaded
### if the provided file changes, on server reload. That allows certificate

### operation. If the server key changes on reload, there may be connection
### failures during the reloading time.

Openconnect VPN server (ocserv) is a VPN server compatible with the
openconnect VPN client. It follows the AnyConnect VPN protocol which 
is used by several CISCO routers.
_EOT_;
};

doc-section = {
  ds-type = 'DESCRIPTION';
  ds-format = 'texi';
  ds-text   = <<-_EOT_
This a standalone server that reads a configuration file (see below for more details),
and waits for client connections. Log messages are redirected to daemon facility.

The server maintains two connections/channels with the client. The main VPN 
channel is established over TCP, HTTP and TLS. This is the control channel as well 
as the backup data channel. After its establishment a UDP channel using DTLS 
is initiated which serves as the main data channel. If the UDP channel fails 
to establish or is temporarily unavailable the backup channel over TCP/TLS 
is being used.

This server supports multiple authentication methods,
including PAM and certificate authentication. Authenticated users are 
assigned an unprivileged worker process and obtain a networking (tun) device 
and an IP from a configurable pool of addresses.

Once authenticated, the server provides the client with an IP address and a list 
of routes that it may access. In order to allow high-speed transfers the 
server does not process or filter packets. It is expected that the server has 
or will set up any required routes or firewall rules. 

It is possible to separate users into groups, which are either present on their
certificate, or presented on login for the user to choose. That way a user may
take advantage of the different settings that may apply per group. See the 
comments on the configuration file for more information.
_EOT_;
};

doc-section = {
  ds-type = 'AUTHENTICATION';
  ds-format = 'texi';
  ds-text   = <<-_EOT_
Users can be authenticated in multiple ways, which are explained in the following
paragraphs. Connected users can be managed using the 'occtl' tool.

@subheading Password authentication
If your system supports Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), then
ocserv will take advantage of it to password authenticate its users.
Otherwise a plain password file similar to the UNIX password file is also supported.
In that case the 'ocpasswd' tool can be used for its management.
Note that password authentication can be used in conjunction with certificate 
authentication.

@subheading GSSAPI authentication
ocserv will take advantage of the MIT Kerberos project GSSAPI libraries, and
allow authentication using any method GSSAPI supports. That is, mainly, Kerberos
authentication. That is often more useful to be combined with PAM or other
password authentication methods so that a fallback mechanism can be used when
GSSAPI fails (e.g., when the user doesn't already have a Kerberos ticket). The
GSSAPI authentication is implemented using SPNEGO over HTTP (RFC4559).

@subheading Public key (certificate) authentication
Public key authentication allows the user to be authenticated
by the possession of the private key that corresponds to a known
to the server public key. That allows the usage of common smart
cards for user authentication.

In ocserv, a certificate authority (CA) is used to sign the client 
certificates. That certificate authority can be local, used only by the 
server to sign its user's known public keys which are then given to 
users in a form of certificates. That authority need also provide a CRL 
to allow the server to reject the revoked clients (see @var{ca-cert, crl}).

In certificate authentication each client presents a certificate and signs
data provided by the server, as part of TLS authentication, to prove his 
possession of the corresponding private key. 
The certificate need also contain user identifying information,
for example, the user ID of the client must be embedded in the certificate's 
Distinguished Name (DN), i.e., in the Common Name, or UID fields. For the 
server to read the name, the @var{cert-user-oid} configuration option 
must be set.

The following examples demonstrate how to use certtool from GnuTLS to
generate such CA.

@subheading Generating the CA
@example
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem
$ cat << _EOF_ >ca.tmpl
cn = "VPN CA"
organization = "Big Corp"
serial = 1
expiration_days = -1
ca
signing_key
cert_signing_key
crl_signing_key
_EOF_
$ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem \
	--template ca.tmpl --outfile ca-cert.pem
@end example

@subheading Generating a local server certificate
The following example generates the server key and certificate
pair. The key generated is an RSA one, but different types
can be used by specifying the 'ecdsa' or 'dsa' options to
certtool.
@example
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile server-key.pem
$ cat << _EOF_ >server.tmpl
cn = "VPN server"
dns_name = "www.example.com"
dns_name = "vpn1.example.com"
#ip_address = "1.2.3.4"
organization = "MyCompany"
expiration_days = -1
signing_key
encryption_key #only if the generated key is an RSA one
tls_www_server
_EOF_
$ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey server-key.pem \
	--load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
	--template server.tmpl --outfile server-cert.pem

@end example

From this point the clients need ca-cert.pem to be able to securely
connect to the server.

Note that it is a better practice to use two separate RSA keys, one
with the signing_key option and another with the encryption_key.

@subheading Generating an external CA-signed server certificate
@example
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile server-key.pem
$ cat << _EOF_ >server.tmpl
cn = "My server"
dns_name = "www.example.com"
organization = "MyCompany"
expiration_days = -1
signing_key
encryption_key #only if the generated key is an RSA one
tls_www_server
_EOF_
$ certtool --generate-request --load-privkey server-key.pem \
	--template server.tmpl --outfile server-cert.csr

@end example

At this point you need to provide the server-cert.csr to your CA,
and they will send you the server certificate.

@subheading Generating the client certificates
Note that it is recommended to leave detailed personal information out of the
certificate as it is sent in clear during TLS authentication. The following
process generates a certificate and converts it to PKCS #12 that is protected
by a PIN and most clients are able to import (the 3DES cipher is used in
the example because it is supported by far more devices than
AES).

@example
$ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile user-key.pem
$ cat << _EOF_ >user.tmpl
cn = "user"
unit = "admins"
expiration_days = 365
signing_key
tls_www_client
_EOF_
$ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey user-key.pem \
	--load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
	--template user.tmpl --outfile user-cert.pem

$ certtool --to-p12 --load-privkey user-key.pem \
	--pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12 \
	--load-certificate user-cert.pem \
	--outfile user.p12 --outder

@end example

@subheading Revoking a client certificate
To revoke the previous client certificate, i.e., preventing the user from
accessing the VPN resources prior to its certificate expiration, use:
@example
$ cat << _EOF_ >crl.tmpl
crl_next_update = 365
crl_number = 1
_EOF_
$ cat user-cert.pem >>revoked.pem
$ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
	--load-ca-certificate ca.pem --load-certificate revoked.pem \
	--template crl.tmpl --outfile crl.pem
@end example
After that you may want to notify ocserv of the new CRL by using
the HUP signal, or wait for it to reload it.

When there are no revoked certificates an empty revocation list
should be generated as follows.
@example
$ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
	--load-ca-certificate ca.pem \
	--template crl.tmpl --outfile crl.pem
@end example
